CHack
-----
A simple roguelike-ish project meant more as an exploration of basic c++ than a fully fleshed-out game.
Players move the character (represented by @) around while avoiding traps (X) and enemies (B, R), gathering coins (o),
before proceeding to the exit flag (P) to win.

Uses the curses library to display in the terminal. Everything else is basic C++ and with some standard library classes.

Installation
-----
Clone and compile the source code. Comes with a CMakeLists if you have CMake.
